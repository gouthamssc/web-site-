							<h3>GEING STARTED</h3>
							<p>From the beginning, it was decided to treat the Apps Challenge as a project.
Microsoft-Project was used
for the project plan, a budget was allocated, and weekly stakeholder meetings and working sessions
were held. Issues and risks were tracked and reported. Tasks that were late were followed-up on and
reassigned if necessary. A formal agenda and minutes were produced to track weekly progress.
All documentation w
as
housed in SharePoint
–
including design materials, marketing, project plans
,
links, reference materials, budget, sponsors, etc. for easy reference.
Since this was our first Hackathon
event, the plans, forms, check off lists, etc. had to be invented, designed and created from scratch. In
addition to the normal project- tracking materials,
a
marketing plan and a logistics plan were created
and refined in parallel to the regular activities</p>
							
							<h4>KEY DECISIONS</h4>
							<p>



<OL> <strong>Duration</strong>:
We watched and participated in events to learn how to organize our event. Some events were three
days and one event was one day with a follow-up two months later. While we received
recommendations favoring an event lasting more than one day to allow more time for mingling and
hacking, we decided on a one day event to allow for a clean start and finish with little follow-up
required.</OL>


<OL> <strong>Location:</strong>
We looked for a County-operated venue to save on costs and focused on the district of Supervisor Nate
Miley because he was a co-host of the event. Our first pick was a fairgrounds site as there were
spacious facilities available. However, the facilities were too large and not close to public
transportation. Even though the facility was free to use, it would be expensive to set it up and get the people to the site (if they would come). This turned out to be a
deal breaker. 
bathe the interior with natural light and enhance its reputation
as a pleasant place to spend time. The library also has become an exceeding popular place in its home
community and is a source of great pride among Castro Valley residents who want to show it off. The
heavy SaturdaAt first we thought</OL>
<oL><strong>THEME</strong>:One key lesson we learned in this process: i
t’s important to have a theme
. The theme sets the stage for
marketing, rules, judging criteria and publicity. It is carried through the entire event.
Seniors and domestic violence were our first choice since these were very important to our host, Nate
Miley, President of the County Board of Supervisors. But our research soon showed there was not
enough data to support these themes so a more general approach was chosen. </oL>
<OL><STRONG>PRIZES</STRONG>:Prize amounts and number of prizes need
ed
to be decided at the beginning both for budget
ary
reasons
and for PR and marketing.
Our first approach was to determine the first three prizes and reserve some
money for other prizes to be determined at a later date or for the day of the event if somethi
ng
amazing
came up. Because of the budget constraints, we stayed with the top three prizes. To determine prize
amounts, we studied other civic Hackathons held in San Diego, Oakland, Detroit and New York to see
what they awarded. The dollar amounts we settled on seemed very reasonable and enough to attract
people from other cities in the county to join. First prize was $3000, second prize was $1500 and third
prize was $500. There were several honorable mentions as well that did not win money but were called
out as winners.
This plan worked very well and was easy to manage.</OL>
